Example of fix's PR title: `fix(#63): implement a method to yield initial value to the state.`

<h2 align="center"> Translations </h2>

You can help to translate the project, even if you don't have any programming knowledge.
All texts used in this project are in `.arb` files located in `/client/lib/l10n/arb`.
To fill a translation gaps in already existing translation file, just edit it.
For example: If you want to add spanish translation, edit the `app_es.arb` file.
If you want to create a translation in new language, simply create a new file in `arb` directory,
with following name: `app_<country_shortcut>.arb`.

English is a primary language of this project, thus all texts that need translation, are
located in `app_en.arb` file.

<b> Translation example: </b>

```bash
/// app_en.arb
{
    "helloWorld": "Hello World!",
    "@helloWorld": {
      "description": "The conventional newborn programmer greeting"
    }
}

/// app_pl.arb
{
    "helloWorld": "Witaj Å›wiecie!"
}
```

<h2 align="center"> Proposing a new features </h2>

You can propose a new feature, by simply raising a new issue on GitHub. Make sure to prefix it with `feature:`

<br> 

<h2 align="center"> Becoming a maintainer </h2>

To become a maintainer, you just have to be an active repository contributor or helper. We do appreciate every kind of
help, so if you don't have enough time to write
a code, it would be also awesome if you can help other contributors understand particular code or concepts. Code reviews
are also extremely important part, thus code reviewers
are always welcome.
