<h2 align="center"> What is Road Runner? </h2>

Road Runner is a fun project, which aims to help people with choosing best transport for their needs.
As MVP it will be a simple app, which lets people register their companies like Uber, Bolt, etc. Drivers can be
assigned to these companies and go online in the app. Normal users can then compare prices, ratings and other aspects 
and choose the best transport for them. If everything go well, it may become real product, integrated with real companies.
